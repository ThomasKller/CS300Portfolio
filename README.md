The problems we solved in this course were "how can we store, sort and remove data in different ways?", and also "how efficient is each one at doing these tasks?". Using different data structures yields different results for storing, sorting, and removing data. This is necessary in code because efficiency is key in many cases, so you must use the right data structure when storing objects. Many of the roadblocks that I faced were involved in the remove and insert algorithms. Luckily the textbook was an excellent tool to help me along my way as all of the topics we were coding were in the textbook work. The largest part of this project is the maintainability and adaptability of the code that I write. I reused the binary search tree code that I had written before in the new project and adapted it to the needs of the course object instead of a bid.
